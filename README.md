# EfficientNet-Based-Classification-of-the-Food101-Dataset

In this project, I implemented EfficientNet to classify images from the Food101 dataset, which contains 101 categories of food. Leveraging the advanced architecture of EfficientNet, I was able to efficiently process and classify the images, achieving an accuracy of 73.31%. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of EfficientNet in handling complex image classification tasks in the domain of food recognition.
